# Diffusion Airport Bipartite Networks
A Method for Benchmarking Diffusion of Infectious Disease at an Airportâ€™s Gates Using Bipartite Networks

This project discusses the role of aviation in the spread of Covid-19 and explores methods to mitigate this risk. It notes that while airplanes and airports facilitated the rapid global spread of the virus, turning a local outbreak into a pandemic, the actual risk of transmission within these spaces is debated. Factors like large spaces, mask policies, cleaning services, and air filtration might reduce transmission, but the close proximity of travelers from various regions in airports and airplanes is a significant risk factor.

Previous research by Wells et al. showed that border controls slowed but couldn't completely stop the virus spread. Their study used incidence data from China, global airport network data, and a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the risk of virus importation over time.

Various strategies are employed to reduce transmission risk, such as modified boarding procedures and modeling the aviation network to understand disease diffusion and alter flights accordingly. The concept of 'travel bubbles' has also been used, allowing travel within certain clusters to continue.

We propose a novel approach at the airport management level, suggesting that clustering gate assignments to service fewer airports could limit the spread of disease. This would isolate high-risk travel corridors, protecting low-risk ones. They hypothesize that more clustered gate-airport assignments could reduce overall spreading potential. However, they note the lack of a method to compare the effectiveness of different gate-assignment strategies and express an interest in developing a method to assess the potential for disease diffusion based on these assignments.
